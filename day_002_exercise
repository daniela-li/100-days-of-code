# Exercise 1: Rewrite your pay computation to give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours.
# Enter Hours: 45
# Enter Rate: 10
# Pay: 475.0

pay = 0.0

input_hours = input("Enter Hours:")
input_rate = input("Enter Rate:")
hours = float(input_hours)
rate = float(input_rate)

if hours < 40:
    pay = rate * hours
    print("Pay: ",pay)
else:
    overtime = hours - 40.0
    pay = 1.5 * overtime * rate + rate * 40.0
    print("Pay: ",pay)

#Exercise 2: Rewrite your pay program using try and except so that your program handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the program. The following shows two executions of the program:

# Enter Hours: 20
# Enter Rate: nine
# Error, please enter numeric input

# Enter Hours: forty
# Error, please enter numeric input

pay = 0.0
hours = 0.0
rate = 0.0

input_hours = input("Enter Hours:")
try:
    hours = float(input_hours)
except: 
    print("Error, please enter numeric input")
    quit()    


input_rate = input("Enter Rate:")
try:
    rate = float(input_rate)
except: 
    print("Error, please enter numeric input")
    quit()

if hours < 40:
    pay = rate * hours
    print("Pay: ",pay)
else:
    overtime = hours - 40.0
    pay = 1.5 * overtime * rate + rate * 40.0
    print("Pay: ",pay)
