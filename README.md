# 100 Days of Code

## **Intro**
I am starting to learn code for Data Analysis.

Because I have an accounting background, I didn't know anything about coding.

Since I decided to change my career from accounting to data analysis in mid-July, I researched what programming language I needed to know and 3 show up: Python, R, and SQL.

Since mid-July until now in 14.08, I was learning somethings from these 3 languages in many different sources: Data Quest, Data Camp, Khan Academy, Free Code Camp, Solo Learn, etc...

But I wasn't consistent, I didn't code every day.

Because of this, I decided to join the #100daysofcode challenge.

So let's begin!

PS: English is not my native language, sorry for the mistakes!

### **Day 1 - 14.08.2020**
To keep track of the progress, I learned how to use Github and started this new repository. 
I am still learning how to use, ~~so I still don't know how to format text for example.~~ Nevermind, I searched on Google and formatted :laughing:

I installed on my notebook, Visual Studio Code, and Github.
I learned how to download this repository in Github, edit the "README" doc in Visual Studio, commit and push the changes. 

So far so good. :smile:

I decided to focus on Python and to use this video course from [Free Code Camp - Introduction to Python for Everybody](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/python-for-everybody/)
This course is based on a book of the same name and the author is the instructor of the videos.    

### **Day 2 - 15.08.2020
I watched some more videos and did the chapter 3 exercises. 
I created a file and uploaded in this repository.
