# 100-days-of-code

## **Intro**
I am starting to learn code for Data Analysis.

Because I have accounting background, I didn't know anything about coding. 

Since I decided to change my career from accounting to data analysis in mid July, I researched what programming language I needed to know and 3 show up: Python, R and SQL. 

Since mid July until now in 14.08, I was learning somethings from these 3 languages in many differents sources: Data Quest, Data Camp, Khan Academy, Free Code Camp, Solo Learn, etc... 

But I wasn't consistent, I didn't code everyday. 

Because of this, I decided to join #100daysofcode challenge

So let's begin!

PS: English is not my first language, sorry for the mistakes! 


### **Day 1 - 14.08.2020**
To keep track of the progress, I learned how to use Github and started this new repository. 

I am still learning how to used, ~~so I still don't know how to format text for example.~~ Nevermind, I searched on Google and formatted :laughing:

I decided to focus on Python and to use this video course from [Free Code Camp - Introduction to Python for Everybody](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/python-for-everybody/)

This course is based from a book of the same name and the autor is the instructor of the videos.
